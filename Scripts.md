# Deep Fake Interview Script

**Interviewer:** Welcome, everyone! Today we’re joined by **Lakshmi Peram**, a Master’s student in Applied Data Science at Syracuse University, who’s been analyzing the SU Women’s Lacrosse team’s performance. Lakshmi, thank you for being here.  

**Lakshmi (Expert):** Thank you for having me! [pause] Hi, my name is **Lakshmi Peram**. I’m pursuing my Master’s in Applied Data Science at Syracuse, [pause] and one of my recent projects involved analyzing the SU Women’s Lacrosse team’s season data to find patterns and insights that could help improve future performance.  

---

**Interviewer:** That sounds exciting. [pause] Let’s start broad — when you looked at the numbers, what stood out most about the team’s season?  

**Lakshmi:** The biggest finding was the difference between home and away games. [pause] At home, SU consistently performed stronger — they had higher scoring averages, better possession, and more consistency. [pause] Away games, however, showed more struggles, which suggests the home crowd and familiar environment gave them a significant edge.  

---

**Interviewer:** That’s interesting. [pause] Were there certain statistics that really predicted whether the team would win or lose?  

**Lakshmi:** Yes — the single most important stat was draw controls. [pause] Whenever SU won more than 60% of draws, their winning percentage jumped to around 70–75%. [pause] That shows how critical possession is in lacrosse — winning the draw set the tone for the rest of the game.  

---

**Interviewer:** So possession really drives momentum?  

**Lakshmi:** Exactly. [pause] Winning draws gave SU early control, allowed them to dictate pace, and created more scoring chances. [pause] In contrast, when they struggled with draws, they were often chasing the game instead of leading it.  

---

**Interviewer:** Were there also areas where the data showed weaknesses?  

**Lakshmi:** Yes. [pause] Turnovers stood out as the biggest challenge. [pause] In games where defensive turnovers increased, opponents capitalized quickly. [pause] Even when SU started strong, high turnovers flipped momentum and often led to losses. [pause] It showed that while the team was great at creating opportunities, ball security still needs improvement.  

---

**Interviewer:** So turnovers sometimes canceled out the advantage of winning draws?  

**Lakshmi:** That’s right. [pause] Even with strong possession, mistakes with the ball erased those benefits. [pause] The data showed a clear pattern: fewer turnovers almost always aligned with wins, while high turnover counts were linked with losses.  

---

**Interviewer:** Based on this, what advice would you give the team for next season?  

**Lakshmi:** The data points to two clear priorities. [pause] First, continue dominating draw controls, because possession is power. [pause] Second, focus heavily on reducing turnovers — that’s about decision-making, discipline, and composure under pressure. [pause] If SU can protect the ball better, they’ll be positioned for a very successful season.  

---

**Interviewer:** That’s a strong outlook. [pause] To wrap up — if you had to sum up your findings in one sentence, what’s the recipe for SU Women’s Lacrosse success?  

**Lakshmi:** Win the draws, [pause] protect the ball, [pause] and the wins will follow.

# Task 06 – Deep Fake Interview Project

## Overview
In this project, I explored various AI-powered tools to generate a **deep fake interview video**. The goal was to simulate a realistic interview scenario based on scripts and prompts I created from my earlier **Task 05** work.  

This README documents the tools I tested, challenges I faced, and the final approach I used to complete the project.

### Video & Lip-Sync Tools
- **HeyGen**
- **Synthesia**
- **Gemini (Veo3)**
- **CapCut**
- **D-ID**
- **Rephrase.ai**
- **Elai.io**
- **Colossyan**
- **Hour One**

### Editing & Creative Tools
- **Canva**
- **Runway ML**
- **Pictory**
- **Lumen5**
- **Descript**
- **Invideo AI**

---

Other tools I reviewed also included **ID generators** and other AI editing platforms.

---

### Observations
- **Payment limitations**: Almost every platform required a subscription to unlock full features.  
- **Lip-sync accuracy**: Gemini’s **Veo3** was the best in terms of accurate lip-syncing but limited to 8s videos.  
- **Ease of merging**: Canva and CapCut worked best for stitching together multiple outputs.  
- **Script alignment**: Some tools did not always follow prompts consistently, even when the same script was given.  


## Key Findings
- Almost **99% of the tools required paid subscriptions** to unlock full features, which made testing difficult.
- Among all, **Gemini Veo3** stood out:
  - Provided **accurate lip-syncing**.  
  - Followed my scripts and prompts more closely than others.  
  - However, it only allowed **8-second video generation**, which wasn’t sufficient for the full project.  

---

## Final Workflow
Since no single tool provided the complete solution, I combined multiple tools to achieve the outcome:

1. **Script Writing**  
   - I wrote the full interview script (two versions: interviewer and interviewee).

2. **Video Generation**  
   - Used **CapCut** to generate video clips for each version (interviewer + interviewee).  
   - Limitation: CapCut couldn’t generate both interview roles in one video.

3. **Merging Clips**  
   - Generated **two separate videos** (one for each role).  
   - Used **Canva** to merge and align them into a **final interview-style video**.

---

## Challenges
- Payment barriers across almost every platform.  
- Tools often didn’t produce results aligned with my exact prompts.  
- Length restrictions (e.g., Gemini Veo3 only producing 8s clips).  

---

## Learnings
- AI tools are powerful but often come with **limitations in free plans**.  
- Combining outputs from **multiple tools** (CapCut + Canva) provided the flexibility to create a more complete final product.  
- **Gemini Veo3** delivered the most impressive lip-sync quality, even though video length was restricted.

---

## Conclusion
This project taught me how to **experiment with different AI video platforms**, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and creatively combine them to achieve the desired result.  

While the final video required extra editing and tool integration, the process gave me a solid understanding of the current **AI deep fake landscape** and its practical limitations.
